# Botty

Mr Stein offered extra credit if we emailed him if he forgot to put up the hw

Built a bot that checks pupilpath every morning and afternoon in order to check if new homework has been uploaded, and if not, it will send an email to Mr. Stein, with myself CC'd, reminding him to put up the homework and allowing me to collect extra credit
